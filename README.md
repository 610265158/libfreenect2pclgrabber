libfreenect2pclgrabber
======================

A grabber for the kinect2 which returns a registered pcl point cloud. 
There is also an example on how to use multiple kinect2s at the same time. 
For any questions don't hesitate to contact me at giacomo.dabisias@gmail.com.
If you have issues with multiple kinects execute "echo 64 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb"
